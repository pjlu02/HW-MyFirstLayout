        <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
        <p>We believe that Tiffany Day has a stressful time packing and planning for trips and that by using this planning application may solve this problem by creating a recommended packing list and possible itinerary for your destination.

        <h2>Target User</h2>
        <p>The user of this product are young adults in their 20â€™s who enjoy traveling with friends and family. Tiffany Day was the user of this product and she is a 23 year old, adventurous female who wants to travel to as many places in the world. She enjoys being prepared before she goes to her trips because wants to be proactive. Tiffany want to go to as many attractions as possible with her friends and meet new ones along the way.</p>

        <h2>Storyboard</h2>
        <p>Next I moved on the definition and ideation, where I created a storyboard and journey map for Tiffany. This shows how Tiffany will be interacting with the travel app and how it helps her pack and plan for her trip to Japan. Then I worked on the user flow of the application and developed how Tiffany will be going through the Plannr app.</p>

          <h2>Wireframe</h2>
          <p>The next step is prototyping the travel app and thinking about how I want the application to look and feel to the user. First I started sketching the wireframes on paper and then I moved on to digital wireframes. Then I had my peers view the first draft of my wireframes to get feedback and iterated them to create my second draft of digital wireframes. Once my wireframes were finalized, I created several prototypes.</p>

          <h2>Testing</h2>
          <p>User testing is the next step after creating prototypes to determine if they are user friendly. I tested my prototype on about 10 users. During the tests, users were not able to identify a clear call to action and there was no way to go back to the previous pages. Also the whole process of planning the trip was confusing to the user. In the end, I was able to solve the problem and the user was able to use the travel app with ease and understood the purpose of it.</p>

      <div class="content5">
          <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
          <p>Iterating is very important when it comes to prototyping and user testing. I discovered through my user tests that if the prototype is too low fidelity, people do not know the purpose of the application. After getting feedback, I made adjustments and created a prototype that was slightly higher fidelity.
